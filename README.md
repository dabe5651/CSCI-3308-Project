# CSCI-3308-Project
Possible website names: Schedule it, that schedule place, link, meet
Team Name: Meeting Masters
Members: Allison MacMillan, David Berstein, Matthew Burn, Samuel Busser, Yifeng Huang
Description: 
  Our project will be to create a website that aids people in finding a common meeting time. Our website will have users create accounts with passwords in order to interact with their various groups/meetings. It will allow for multiple meetings to be scheduled and viewed. Users will enter days and times they are free to meet for a specific meeting, and a display will show a unique calendar with each member's availability and preferred meeting place(s), as well as a calendar with the overlapping times. It will also allow members to leave comments/chat about their specific meeting time and place. 
  Users will go to the homepage to log in or set up an account. After logging in, users can either create a meeting or access a meeting they've been invited to. If the user decides to create a new meeting, that user is made to be the "Meeting Master." When creating a meeting, the user must specify the proposed days of meeting as well as emails/usernames of other members, as well as a title of the meeting and a short description if desired. Once on the page of a specific meeting, user can switch between availabities of specific other people and an overall overlap schedule. The times that people are available will be displayed on a calender-type image with unique colors for each member. If not everyone in the group can make a same time, the Meeting Master will receive notifications/emails with suggestions that allow a majority of people to still make it, or be prompted to re-do the meeting.
   The first step of our project will be to decide a hosting service for our website. Secondly, we will learn how to allow and keep track of user log-ins/passwords. Next, we need to make a "Create a Meeting" page for the Meeting Master to propose a meeting and invite other members. After this, the scheduling page(s) will be added. Next, we will allow our site to send email invites including a link to a log in/meeting page. If possible, we may add a notification capability in addition to the email capability.
Vision Statement: We would like to make it easier to set a meeting time and place for a disconnected group of people.
Motivation: It was very difficult for us to find a time to meet to discuss and plan our project. 
Risks: 
  1) None of us have ever made a website
  2) We have little to no knowledge of databases
  3) We have to learn a new language
  4) It will be difficult to accurately define the scope of the project
  5) We have a lot to learn and no experience
  
Risk Mitigation Plan:
  1) We will teach ourselves how to make a website using online tutorials, as well as our textbook and the help of our TA's office hours.
  2) We will read up on databases.
  3) We are excited to learn javascript as it will help us in our futures. We will take many tutorials.
  4) We will have meetings often to better define the scope of the project as we continue using the agile method.
  5) We will try very hard to teach ourselves what we don't know. This is most of our first example of a real-life programming experience and we know that it will be useful for our careers so we will be very dedicated.
  
Version Control: We will be using github and our repository is named CSCI-3308-Project.
Development Method: We have decided to use the agile software development methodology. This consists of the following steps:
  1) Product backlog creation: decide the feature and steps needed for our project
  (steps 2-5 repeated as needed)
  2) Sprint planning and sprint backlog creation: deciding which parts of the backlog to be tacked for each milestone
  3) Working on the sprint: everyone working on their specific task for each sprint/round
  4) Testing and product demonstration: testing our project and showing features most recently worked on
  5) Retrospective and next sprint: looking back at past sprints and planning the next ones accordingly
  6) Conclusion: submit project to Dr. Paradise and be proud of what we made
Collaboration Tool: We have decided to use the app groupMe, the group messaging app, as our collaboration tool.
